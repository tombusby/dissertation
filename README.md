A C Compiler and Virtual Machine Implemented in Haskell
============

*Submitted May 2012, in partial fulfilment of the conditions of the award of the degree BSc (Hons) Computer Science at the University of Nottingham.*

This repository contains my dissertation in pdf format and the source code that accompanies it.

It implements a compiler for a very limited subset of the C programming language. The language that the compiler targets is assembly for a custom, simply virtual stack machine.
